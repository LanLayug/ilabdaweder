A basic weather forecast for my hometown Bacolor, Pampanga (and neighboring towns/cities) using Open Weather Map API.

###### Page is coded on the client-side so the API key is... yes, exposed.

### TO DO LIST:
*  hide api key in the back-end
*  ui, typography, color, header, ui.
*  images from wikimedia commons to be overlayed (subtle) in the main tile
*  clean your code
